##  About Me

-  Hi! I am Ioana and I self-taught myself a bit of web development 💻.

-  If you know any way in which you think I can grow personally and professionally, don't hesitate to let me know

-  I think learning is a life-long process. Also, I like cats a lot. 😺 Looking forward to working with you.
